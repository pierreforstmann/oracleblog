<p>Today 14th of October 2015 Oracle Corp. has released  <a href="https://livesql.oracle.com">Oracle Live SQL</a>: this is a new online tool somewhat similar to Oracle Application Expresse (APEX) SQL Workshop feature. Some time ago I have used SQL Workshop on apex.oracle.com to check <a href="https://pierreforstmanndotcom.wordpress.com/2015/05/26/under-the-hood-of-apex-oracle-com-database/" /> what is under apex.oracle.com database hood</a>. </p>
<p>I have just run the same script on livesql.oracle.com:</p>
<pre>
select * from sys.v_$version;
select sys_context('USERENV','HOST') from dual;
select sys_context('USERENV','OS_USER') from dual;
select sys_context('USERENV','DB_NAME') from dual;
select sys_context('USERENV','DB_UNIQUE_NAME') from dual;
select sys_context('USERENV','INSTANCE_NAME') from dual;
select sys_context('USERENV','CON_NAME') from dual;
select sys_context('USERENV','CON_ID') from dual;
select * from session_roles;
select * from session_privs;
select * from sys.v_$active_instances;
select * from sys.all_directories;
select count(*) from sys.v_$session_connect_info;
select * from sys.v_$session_connect_info where rownum = 1;
select opname, start_time, last_update_time, message from sys.v_$session_longops;
select count(*) from all_users;
select count(*) from sys.sysfiles;
select round(sum(blocks*8192/(1024*1024*1024))) as gb from sys.sysfiles;
select * from sys.sysfiles where rownum =1;
</pre>
<p>The script output is <a href="https://pierreforstmanndotcom.wordpress.com/livesql.getinfo.html">here</a>.<br />
<br />
Most statements fail with <code>ORA-01003: no statement parsed</code> which means that access to database views has been more restricted than in APEX.</p>
<p>What is sure is that livesql.oracle.com database:</p>
<li>
is running Oracle 12c because CON_ID is different from 0
</li>
<li>
is a container database because again CON_ID is different 0 (and note that CON_NAME is set to 'PDBPRD').
</li>
<p>
It is likely (but I cannot be sure) that this also a RAC database because instance_name ALSPRD2 has a number added to DB_NAME and DB_UNIQUE_NAME (ALSPRD).</p>
<p>That's all folks !</p>
